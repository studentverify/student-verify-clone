          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800">1. 100% Success Guarantee</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            We guarantee that we will successfully verify you for the student discount you are seeking through our service. If, for any reason, we are unable to complete the verification process successfully for the specific deal you paid for, you are entitled to a full refund of the $65 service fee.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800">2. Eligibility for Refund</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            A full refund will be issued under the following circumstances:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 ml-4">
            <li>We are unable to verify your eligibility for the specific student discount you paid for.</li>
            <li>The verification process exceeds our stated 24-48 hour processing time due to our fault, and you no longer wish to proceed with the service.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800">3. Non-Eligibility for Refund</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            Refunds will generally not be issued if:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 ml-4">
            <li>You provide inaccurate or incomplete information that prevents us from completing the verification.</li>
            <li>You decide to cancel the service after the verification process has been successfully completed by us.</li>
            <li>You are verified, but the third-party merchant (e.g., SheerID partner) changes their discount terms or discontinues the offer after your successful verification.</li>
          </ul>
